# 2D-Game-SDL2_1
Unfinished/Unnamed Tile-based 2D game made with C++ and the SDL library

One of my many attempts at building a game from scratch in 2015\
I originally intended to recreate something like the puzzle game, Shove It!\
You can move around a small predefined area and add/remove tiles to build a map\
There are also pushable tiles, with the help of a simple collision system

Controls:\
WASD:        Move player\
Left Mouse:  Place tile\
Right Mouse: Remove tile
E:           Reloads the map
